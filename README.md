### 1. Non-Signalized Scenarios
- Ego vehicle undertaking a left turn at a non-signalized junction.
- Ego and global vehicle crossing while turning right at a non-signalized junction.
- Global vehicle straight with Ego from the left at a non-signalized junction.
- Global vehicle turns right and ends up in the same direction as the ego vehicle at a non-signalized junction.

### 2. Pedestrian Interactions
- Pedestrian crossing at zebra crossing with no traffic lights.
- Pedestrian running at the green light.
- Pedestrian crossing from behind an obstruction.
- Ego vehicle to pedestrian crossing the road.
- Ego vehicle to pedestrian in the path.
- Ego vehicle to pedestrian turning.
- Pedestrians walking along the road.

### 3. Vulnerable Road Users (Other than Pedestrians)
- Ego vehicle with bicyclist crossing.
- Ego vehicle with bicyclist in the same lane.
- Motorbike crossing from behind an obstruction.

### 4. Complex Intersections and Maneuvers
- Ego vehicle turning.
- Ego vehicle approaching a turning lead vehicle.
- Entering a roundabout with another vehicle.
- Ego vehicle driving on an empty roundabout.
- The oncoming global vehicle turns right at the junction.

### 5. Risky and Unexpected Scenarios
- Global vehicle running the red traffic light.
- Global vehicle swerving toward ego vehicle.
- Global vehicle backing up into ego vehicle.
- Global vehicle cutting in front of the ego vehicle.

### 6. Environmental Challenges
- Drive through road environments with obstructed views.
- Navigate on roads without lane lines.
- Respond to unanticipated weather and lighting conditions.
